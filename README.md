This is my submission for the final project of an Intro to Machine Learning 
course I took at UC Denver. 

To build the notebook, you must first unzip the higgs machine learning challenge
data set and make sure it has the same name, within the same directory.  

Running ```gunzip atlas-higgs-challenge-2014-v2.csv.gz``` should do the trick. 

Disclaimers, sources, and citations are located in the nb.html file.
